```
From 10 -> 14 years old I played video games instead of olympiads.
My League was okay, peaking diamond 5. I was better at shooters,
peaking #5-7 on CoD's global leaderboards in SnD for 4 months, and
and Global Elite in CS:GO. I started training to go professional
with MLG and ESEA, but then got interested in programming...

From 14 -> 24 years old I focused on software programming. During
high school I won multiple hackathon awards. During college
I studied mathematics, information theory, and had various
internships. I cancelled a frontend internship with Mr. Musk in
order to learn more about crypto at Hacker School. After college
I brownfielded a cloud compiler and greenfielded a distributed
provisioning system for 10k engineers, which saved $XMM/year.

From 24 -> ??, I am narrowing my focus on machine learning
systems by building two compilers: one for software 1.0
and the other for software 2.0. In my spare time I'm working
on a personal robot.

1. I want to work on cool tech.
2. I assume the local mininum.
3. I want to have fun.

The future is bright,
JZ.
